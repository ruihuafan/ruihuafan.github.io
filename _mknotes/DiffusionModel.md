# Introduction

The task of classifying, or more explicitly, recognizing mixed-state phases is a new fundamental question. Specifically, if we consider decohered states, a small subset of mixed states, the question normally involves adding noise and identify the residual quantum order in it (or quantum error correction). This procedure is quite similar to the diffusion model. Here we want to follow this classic paper [Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03585) to first learn the basic idea of diffusion model. Then we will follow  this paper [Local Diffusion Models and Phases of Data Distributions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06614) to contemplate its relation to mixed-state phases. I also recommend [this talk](https://pirsa.org/26020036).
