I have not decided what to put here. 

Here is a random imcomplete note on short-range entangled state just as a place-holder

When I visited Tsinghua in 2018, Yang was working on a mathematical conjecture and would like a few students to verify it for him. Here is a MMA note stating that conjecture and some numerical tests. It might be related to Lee-Yang zeros.
