I would like to share some notes from (1) courses that I either took or taught during my PhD (2) discussions with my friends and colleague (3) random thoughts and learnings. Many of them are actually not really finished. What is even worse is that they probably contain tons of typos and mistakes. You are more than welcome to email me questions or comments.

## Notes from courses

### Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics

- [Probabilities](notes/course_notes/probability.pdf)
- [Free quantum gases](notes/course_notes/free_quantum_gas.pdf)

### Special Topics in condensed matter physics

- [Linear response](notes/course_notes/linear_response.pdf)

## Random notes

Exact solutions are rare in many-body physics. They often reply on delicate mathematical structures. One object that keeps showing up in various types of questions is SL2 group. Here are some notes collecting related results.

- [SL2 group and unitary representations](/notes/sl2R.pdf)
- [SL2 = Harmonic oscillator](/notes/sl2_and_harmonic_oscillator.pdf)
- [SL2 and AdS2](/notes/ads2.pdf)
- [SL2 and operator growth (to appear)]

Conformal field theories, another much larger class of solvable theories, can be regarded as an upgraded version of the above SL2 story. Here are some notes on this topics.

- [Driven oscillator and Rep of Virasoro can meet at Hill's eqn](/notes/CFTs/hill_eqn_coadjoint_orbit.pdf)
- [Notes for a journal club](/notes/CFTs/CFTNote2018.pdf)
- [Global quench in CFTs](/notes/CFTs/global_quench.pdf)
- [Spectral form factor of CFTs](/notes/CFTs/SFF_CFT.pdf)
- [CFT approach to bipartite entanglement of gapped states](/notes/CFTs/TopoEntanglementCFT.pdf)
